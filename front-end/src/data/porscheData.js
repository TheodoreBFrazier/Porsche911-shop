            "description": "The birth of a legend. Porsche wanted to offer a larger, four-seater version of its 356, specifically its expensive and complicated Carrera 2. The all-new car featuring a new chassis with MacPherson struts, semi-trailing arms and torsion bar springs, and a brand-new air-cooled, OHC flat-six “boxer” engine mounted in the rear of the car and coupled with either a four or five-speed manual gearbox.Assembled in Leipzig, Germany, the 911 initially made 128 horsepower from its 1,991cc engine and a top speed of 131 mph.",

            "description": "A decade into the 911’s life and Porsche decided an update was needed and gave the 911 a big makeover. Known as the ‘G-model’ 911 it sold almost 200,000 vehicles and was the longest running 911 series, being produced from 1973 to 1989. In addition to a Coupé and a Targa version, a Cabriolet was also available. There were meaningful design changes to the 911, most notably a new raised bumper design with black plastic bellows (designed to meet U.S crash test standards). Between the tail lights of the G models is a red panel and a Porsche logo that is red or black, depending on the model year. The rear number plate is flanked by two large rubber buffers with integrated number plate lighting. Inside, the G Series 911 came with added safety features to appease U.S regulators and consumers, including three-point safety belts fitted as standard and seats with integrated headrests.",

            "description": "The Porsche 911 (Type 996) was a new design developed by Pinky Lai. While the car incorporated the classic lines and tear-drop shape of all the 911’s earlier iterations, Type 996 was nearly a complete reimagining of the 911 sports car, and carried very little over from its predecessors. The 996 featured all-new bodywork, a reimagined interior and controversial (ugly) headlight shape (which mimicked the entry-level Porsche Boxster). It was also the first water-cooled engine ever used in a 911.  The 996 shared no body panels, no underbody structure and no major mechanical components with previous 911s. The only carry-overs were from the earlier 911 (Type 993) from which the front suspension, rear multi-link suspension, and a six-speed gearbox were repurposed after some revisions to make them current.",

            "description": "In July, 2004, Porsche unveiled the Porsche Type 997. It featured the same classic silhouette as all earlier variants of the Porsche 911, and included design cues – most especially a return to the clear, oval headlights with separate blinkers – that were found on older 911 models.While the Porsche 911 Type 997 featured a refined, race-inspired appearance, the car was hailed for being a true high-performance vehicle. Most notably, the 997 also marked a big growth in the Porsche 911 product line in terms of sheer options and sales volumes (the 997 became the best-selling generation of 911 to date). There was a 997 911 model for every taste, with over 24 models available in every performance, body style and combinations imaginable.Model improvements came in late 2008 made the 997 even more efficient thanks to direct fuel injection and a double-clutch transmission and was known as the 997.2 series, running till the series ended in 2012.",

            "description": "Longer, sleeker, and with more powertrain and drivetrain options than ever, the 991 generation Carrera is the seventh generation in the Porsche 911s history (the third platform for the 911 since the car’s inception). It was larger and more refined than the outgoing 997 as well as being lighter and more powerful. The car continued to feature the same characteristic teardrop shape for which the 911 is immediately recognizable to just about any automotive enthusiast. However, two unique design principles were followed that helped refine the character of the car. First, the arch of the roofline was reduced and re-design to taper gradually to the rear of the car.  Second, the front wings (the assembly that includes the headlight and surrounding structure) were now placed higher than the lid. The interior and technology was a big upgrade over the 997 due largely to the increased competition in the segment and competing marques with luxurious interiors.",

            "years": "current",
            "description": "The 992 generation of Porsche 911 carries forward the use of twin-turbocharged engines throughout the entire Carrera range, which was a practice first introduced in the outgoing 991.2 generation of cars. Nevertheless, the Turbo models continue to differentiate themselves from the other variants by having the most powerful (3.7L) engines, and come exclusively with all-wheel drive.This will make the 992 the first complete generation in the German automaker’s history to exclusively use forced induction power plants; although, all signs do currently point towards the upcoming 992-gen GT3 and GT3 RS remaining naturally-aspirated, which would be the exception while not breaking tradition with any previous iterations of those models.In continuing with the always notable evolution of the 911, the 992 provides yet another significant shift from the generation preceding it. The ubiquitous use of twin-turbocharged engines is just one of many material changes at play, with distinguishable developments in the car’s design language, drivetrain and chassis, all forming part of the transformation.",
